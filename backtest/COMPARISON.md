## **Analysis: Why Did the Improved Strategy Underperform?**

### ❌ **Over-Optimization for Risk Management**

1. **Too Strict Entry (-5% threshold)**
   - Missed many profitable opportunities
   - Only 110 trades vs 248 (less than half)
   - In a trending-up market (2023), waiting for -5% dips meant missing rallies

2. **Premature Profit Taking (3% exit)**
   - Exited winners too early
   - Original strategy's 5% target captured more upside
   - In mean reversion, letting winners run is crucial

3. **Stop Loss Hurt in Volatile Market**
   - -10% stop loss triggered on temporary dips
   - Mean reversion needs patience through volatility
   - Locked in losses that would have recovered

4. **Max Hold Period (30 days) Was Counterproductive**
   - Forced exits on positions that needed more time
   - Example: UPL sold at +0.4% after 33 days (could have recovered more)

## **Key Learnings**

### ✅ **What Worked in Improved Strategy:**
- **Lower drawdown** (5.32% vs 8.26%) - Risk management worked
- **Higher win rate** (63% vs unknown) - Better quality trades
- **Lower costs** (₹2,200 vs ₹4,960) - Less overtrading

### ❌ **What Didn't Work:**
- **Too conservative in bull market** - 2023 was a strong year for NIFTY
- **Premature exits** - 3% profit target too low
- **Missed opportunities** - -5% entry too strict

---

## **Recommended Hybrid Strategy (Alternate 2)**

Combine the best of both:

1. **Entry Threshold:** -3% (middle ground)
   - Not too loose (original: any dip)
   - Not too strict (improved: -5%)

2. **Exit Threshold:** 4% (middle ground)
   - Better than 3% (too early)
   - Faster than 5% (reduces risk)

3. **Stop Loss:** -12% (looser)
   - Allows for volatility
   - Still protects against catastrophic losses

4. **Averaging:** Same position size (keep from improved)
   - More effective than 1 share

5. **Position Limit:** 5 (keep from improved)
   - Prevents over-diversification

6. **Max Hold:** Remove or extend to 60 days
   - Mean reversion needs time

7. **No averaging if already down -8%**
   - Don't throw good money after bad

## **Conclusion**

The **original strategy** won in 2023 because:
- 2023 was a bull market (NIFTY up ~20%)
- Frequent trading caught many small rebounds
- No stop loss allowed positions to recover

The **improved strategy** would likely win in:
- Bear or sideways markets
- High volatility periods
- When risk management is critical

**Next Step:** Test Alternate 2 (Hybrid) to find the sweet spot!
