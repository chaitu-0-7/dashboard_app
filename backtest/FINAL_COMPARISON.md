## **Analysis**

### **Winner: Alternate 2** 🏆

**Why Alternate 2 Wins:**
- **Highest return:** 17.95%
- **100% win rate:** Every exit was profitable
- **Lowest brokerage:** ₹1,980 (only 99 trades)
- **Acceptable drawdown:** 9.46%

### **Why Alternate 3 Underperformed:**

1. **45-day exit hurt more than helped**
   - Forced exits on positions that would have recovered
   - Example: MARUTI sold at -0.4% after 45 days (could have waited for profit)
   - In a bull market, patience pays off

2. **Bigger positions = Bigger drawdown**
   - ₹4k positions → 12.78% drawdown (vs 9.46%)
   - More capital at risk per trade

3. **More trades = More fees**
   - 186 trades vs 99 (88% more)
   - ₹3,720 brokerage vs ₹1,980 (88% more)
   - Time-based exits caused unnecessary churn

## **Key Learnings**

### ✅ **What Works:**
1. **Entry at -2%** (sweet spot, not too loose/tight)
2. **₹2k per trade** (balanced position sizing)
3. **8 max positions** (focused but diversified)
4. **Meaningful averaging** (₹2k, not 1 share)
5. **No time-based exits** (let mean reversion work)

### ❌ **What Doesn't Work:**
1. **Time-based exits in bull markets** (cuts winners short)
2. **₹4k positions** (higher risk, higher drawdown)
3. **Too many positions** (dilutes returns)

## **Your Concern About Idle Capital:**

You were right that 8 positions leaves capital idle, BUT:
- **Alternate 3 proved bigger positions = worse results**
- **Quality > Quantity:** 8 focused positions beat 10+ scattered ones
- **Idle cash is not wasted:** It's dry powder for better opportunities

**Better solution than increasing positions:**
- Keep 8 max positions
- Use idle cash for **opportunistic entries** when market dips hard
- Don't force trades just to deploy capital
