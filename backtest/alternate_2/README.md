# Alternate Strategy 2: Simple & Practical Improvements

## Philosophy: Keep it Simple, Fix What's Broken

### **Current Strategy's Real Problems:**

1. **Buys too early** - Enters at -0.1% below MA (too eager)
2. **Averaging is useless** - Buying 1 share doesn't help
3. **No max positions** - Can end up with 20 stocks (too scattered)

### **Simple Fixes (Only 3 Changes):**

#### **1. Wait for Better Entry (-2% minimum)**
- **Current:** Buys at any dip below MA
- **New:** Only buy when at least -2% below MA
- **Why:** Better entry = better profit potential
- **Impact:** Fewer but higher quality trades

#### **2. Smarter Averaging (Match Initial Size)**
- **Current:** Averages with 1 share (useless)
- **New:** Average with same ₹2000 position
- **Why:** Actually lowers your average meaningfully
- **Impact:** Losing positions can recover faster

#### **3. Limit Open Positions (Max 8)**
- **Current:** No limit, can have 15+ positions
- **New:** Maximum 8 positions at once
- **Why:** Focus capital, easier to manage
- **Impact:** Bigger positions = better returns per trade

## **That's It. No Stop Loss. No Time Limits. No Complexity.**

### Expected Results:
- **Similar or better returns** (better entries)
- **Lower brokerage** (fewer trades)
- **Better capital efficiency** (focused positions)
- **Meaningful averaging** (can actually recover)

### What We're NOT Changing:
- ✅ Exit at 5% profit (works fine)
- ✅ Average at -3% loss (good trigger)
- ✅ 20-day MA (standard)
- ✅ Basic mean reversion logic (sound)
