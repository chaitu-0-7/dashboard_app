# Alternate Strategy 3: Optimal Capital Utilization

## **Key Insight:**
With ₹40,000 capital and ₹4,000 per trade → **10 positions max** for full utilization

## **Changes from Alternate 2:**

### 1. **₹4,000 per trade** (was ₹2,000)
- Bigger positions = Better returns
- 40k / 4k = 10 positions

### 2. **Max 10 positions** (was 8)
- Full capital utilization
- Better diversification
- Less idle cash

### 3. **45-day exit rule** (NEW)
- If position hasn't hit 5% profit in 45 days → Exit at market
- Frees up stuck capital
- Prevents money sitting idle in losing positions
- Even if at -2% loss, better to exit and redeploy

### 4. **Keep everything else:**
- Entry at -2% below MA ✅
- Exit at 5% profit ✅
- Average with ₹4,000 at -3% ✅

## **Expected Outcome:**
- **Higher returns** (bigger positions)
- **Less idle cash** (10 positions vs 8)
- **No stuck capital** (45-day rule)
- **Better diversification** (10 stocks vs 8)
